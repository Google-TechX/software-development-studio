## Requirements



### 1 - Demo

* Demonstrate your wiki by sharing your screen.

Tip: Record a backup video of your working wiki just in case there are technical challenges the day of the presentation. Google Meet can be used:  [https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308681?hl=en](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308681?hl=en)
* Describe the intended audience of your wiki project, and how your project meets their needs.

### 2 - Slides

### 3 - Technical challenge(s) -- Present design for formatting

* Describe at least one technical challenge you encountered and how you solved it.

### 4 - Collaboration challenge(s) -- Retrospective

### 5 - Time between 16-20 minutes

Aim for your talk to be 18 minutes long. It must be at least 16 minutes long. At 20 minutes, your talk will be cut-off (muted by an instructor).

### 6 - Each group member speaks

Speaking time does not have to be equally distributed amongst team members, but everyone in the group needs to share something.
