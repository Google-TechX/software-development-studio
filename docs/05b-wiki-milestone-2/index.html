      <google-codelab-step label="Overview" duration="0">
        <p>For this milestone, you&#39;ll be creating a design doc for your wiki formatting implementation.</p>
<p>This is expected to be completed as a group.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wiki Milestone 1</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to collaborate on a design doc with your team</li>
<li>Security considerations of allowing formatting in HTML</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Getting started" duration="0">
        <ol type="1">
<li>Create a Google Doc and share it with your group.</li>
<li>Add a title to the document (&#34;Wiki Formatting Design Document&#34;), author names and emails, and add section headers: &#34;Background&#34;, &#34;Proposal&#34;, &#34;Implementation Details&#34;, &#34;Security Considerations&#34;, &#34;Alternatives Considered&#34;, and &#34;Resources&#34;.</li>
<li>Collaborate on the document with your group. Reference the remainder of the codelab for guidance on what goes in each section.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Background Section" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, describe the problem you&#39;re trying to solve (formatting). <strong>Keep it brief:</strong> just a few sentences or less. Don&#39;t go into your proposal or implementation details.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Proposal Section" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, describe a high level overview of how you intend to implement Wiki Formatting. Keep it just a couple paragraphs or less.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Implementation Details Section" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, you get to describe the fine details on how you plan to implement the formatting requirements. Feel free to add subsections here as necessary to talk about individual functionalities.</p>
<p>This section should be the longest section of your design document. While small code snippets are permissible to discuss implementation, they should be generally backed by textual descriptions.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Security Considerations Section" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, describe how your design mitigates dangerous HTML insertions. For example, prevents the following code snippet from being displayed as HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;window.alert(&#34;Hacked!&#34;)&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Alternatives Considered Section" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, describe alternative approaches (create one alternative approach per subsection), and why you decided not to use these approaches.</p>
<p>You must discuss at least two alternative approaches.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Resources Section" duration="0">
        <p>This section should be a bulleted-list of links or resources that may be useful to a reader looking to get more background on your document.</p>
<p>You must link at least one resource.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Submission" duration="0">
        <p>To submit your document, press <code>File &gt; Download &gt; PDF</code> in Google Docs. Upload the PDF to your Cloud Console, and commit it as <code>FormattingDesignDoc.pdf</code> in your wiki repository. Push the commit to GitLab to submit.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Requirements" duration="0">
